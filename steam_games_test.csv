922880,Siberian Dawn,"Sep 20, 2018",0 - 20000,0,0,4.99,2,"More Than Just Another Deckbuilder... Road To 5.0 We are currently on the road to Siberian Dawn 5.0, working on a number of significant additions to improve the presentation of the game, and the latest update 4.6 brings the latest additions made on this journey so far over the last few months with 3 new training missions added to the base game. So currently in the game you can play a set of 4 interactive Tutorials and 4 Training Missions, but there is still much more content to be added before 5.0 and listed below you will see the content still to come. Mission packs 1 and 2 also currently each give you 3 full missions of the Siberian Dawn story. - A set of Missions comparable to the Missions in the Mission Packs, set before the Siberian Dawn story - Skirmish mode with the new content of the Base game, DLC will then add extra content to this mode - Crisis mode with the new content of the Base game, DLC will then add extra content to this mode - Ark section that will contain various unlocks and uncover the secrets of Siberian Dawn This game is a strategic card based wargame with deckbuilding elements and the detailed tutorials will take you through how to play the game. As it was built to be a game that offered a lot of strategic options during a mission it is not a simple deckbuilder but is a game that requires thought and a bit of time to learn its mechanics. Overview Siberian Dawn is an original, solo, digital card game that combines the core soul of a deck builder with the tactical power of a war game and the strategic challenge of crisis management. You are an Overseer in the Union, one of the tactical controllers who has to deal with the increasing dangers facing the Union through Objective based Missions. Recruit and deploy Units, enlist the help of the Guilds, and build your Bond with those in the shadows, whilst trying to control the conflict unfolding before you. The base game contains a detailed series of interactive tutorials and 4 Training Mission that will teach you how to play the game, and the Mission Packs available as DLC each add 3 new Missions of the Siberian Dawn story. The World In Siberian Dawn you play the part of an Overseer in the Union, an industrial state covering what we know as Europe. Overseers are the tactical experts of the Union and responsible for quickly dealing with troubles as they arise using a limited resource pool, controlled squad level force, and possible support from the Guilds. Siberian Dawn has a heavy character driven setting, in a gritty near future military world that mixes in medieval and supernatural horror elements to the theme. The game starts as hostility has been growing in Industrial Habit IH-54 of the Eastern Zones for the last few weeks. Outcasts are rumoured to have been stirring up this dissent and it is believed they are connected to a cult called the Dawn, Overseers have been assigned to deal with this unrest and you are one of them. Each Mission will give the Overseer a series of Objectives to complete which have variety and offer the Overseer different challenges during the Mission. Missions will be playable individually but also form a narrative story as the Overseer uncovers the truth of the Dawn and how deep secrets go within the Union and Guilds. Mission Example An example Training mission in the base game is First Run, which is aimed to give you a taste of Siberian Dawn and the basics of a Mission. The Objectives in this Mission will take you through the steps towards the final Objective to kill the 4 VBots, the Missions in Mission Pack 1 and those to follow will contain multiple Objectives offering a longer more challenging game. First Run also contains 2 Units, the Grunt and the Scribe. The Grunt is your basic Union military Unit that will be used to attack the VBots, and the Scribe is a Guild support Unit who will help you gain Glory. Full Missions add 18 new Units to these 2 basic ones. Lore Engine Siberian Dawn is the first game to use the Lore Deck Building Engine, taking the core of a Deck Builder and adding the depth of a War Game to give the player a more strategic challenge. Dual Deck Development – Build a Resource deck and Tactics deck. Bond System – Adds 1 of 4 Guild specific contacts in a Mission (Available with Mission Pack 1) Hub System – Context relevant controls presented on a central set of pods. Fate Helix – Action resolution using a deck system allowing control over the risk of the results. Multiple Resource Management – Overseer has to balance a range of Resources to succeed.

It features all the intensity, depth, and lovingly handcrafted pixels of a classic arcade shooter, with a modern twist: deeply-integrated cooperative gameplay. Unlike most top-down shooters, which give multiple players a shared pool of lives or continues, Jamestown does something different. So long as any player survives, the team can be brought back from death. By giving every player the power to rescue their team from the jaws of destruction, Jamestown creates an exhilarating cooperative experience where everyone’s contribution truly matters. Win or lose, your team will do it together.

Grab a friend, or a complete stranger, and face-off for a heart-pumping, head-thumping good time! Make 'em sweat! ************************************************************ READ BEFORE YOU PURCHASE EARLY ACCESS ************************************************************ PLEASE read through our materials in the discussions including 'What to Expect From Early Access'. You can also watch our casual walk-through on YouTube (and above) with the Dev and remember that this is an EARLY ACCESS game with almost NO SOLO PLAY content ATM, and VERY LITTLE polish. That will change as we move along, but we want to be up-front and very clear to tentative players. If you are interested in getting in early and helping with feedback about a multiplayer VR boxing game then this is for you! Join our discord and make sure you have some friends to play with because finding unscheduled pVp matches is still sporadic as our player base grows. Of course we'd love to have your expertise help us grow! BE AWARE BEFORE BUYING: - NOTHING IN THIS GAME IS BALANCED YET (that's why we are in Early Access) - THE SINGLE AI IS FOR TARGET PRACTICE ONLY (He is a TESTING opponent for our team to gather feedback on, nowhere near finished. During Early Access we are developing solo play AI, making them intelligent and adding 25+ punch combos, weaves, blocks, dodges as well as an additional 19 more AI opponents). But for the love of all that is good, please don't buy this game so early into Early Access if you just want to test yourself against the AI - you WILL be disappointed and you WILL leave a bad review ;-) - THE HIT REACTIONS ARE ROUGH ROUGH ROUGH (the arms and gloves don't feel very good to hit on the opponents yet) - this is our current focus for the next batch of updates and has always been on our roadmap (check out our detailed plans on discord if you're interested in seeing where we're taking this game in the very near future). - ANIMATIONS are all first drafts. - MULTIPLAYER WORKS WELL BUT IS STILL VERY ROUGH OVERALL - we're aiming for realism and have anti-spam hitting mechanics. But you aren't going to easily find opponents yet, so if you buy, plan to join discord to schedule your matches, OR buy with a friend who you can regularly play with. So again, if you are purchasing this because you expect the feel of a boxing game that has many YEARS in development then please PASS for now. We will get there! But this game is less than SIX MONTHS through development (with one dev) :-) and we ONLY launched this early to start letting people know about what we are building and to give folks an opportunity to jump in for some fun (unpolished) pVp. The game is rough! So if you're joining us now, expect ROUGH, but please don't hold that against us in your reviews at this point since we have gone to great lengths to warn you :-). Perhaps give us a chance to polish up the foundation before you judge us too harshly. We're building this game because we love boxing and PvP, and we are learning as we go. *NOTE THAT OCULUS SUPPORT IS PLANNED BUT NOT CURRENTLY SUPPORTED* Does it work? Usually (via cabled link). However, our recommendation is that you do NOT purchase Early Access at this time if you intend to play via Oculus. We will change our message here when we officially begin to support Oculus HMDs. ************************************************************ Use the solo training exercises, take on the AI, or jump right into what EOC Boxing was designed to do and challenge your friends to three different match types including exhibition, amateur or professional ranked fights where your reputation, stats, virtual cash, and boxer’s title is on the line. EOC is a physically demanding game that will push you to improve your cardio and your core. But you'll need some space to add this energetic workout to your routine. Make sure you have at least 1.5m by 2m of unobstructed space to swing and then tell your family members to stand back - WAY back. Or better yet, pick up another headset and challenge them to a no-impact, no-holds-barred grudge match to prove your unconditional supremacy! (separate VR rooms highly recommended) We want to stress once more that EOC is currently Early Access and we are looking for your feedback, so if you love boxing and don't mind giving us a glove (er hand), we're all ears about how we can make this game the best that it can possibly be. What’s coming up in the very near future? We’re glad you asked! Greater player customization, multiple avatars of gender and race, server moderated multiplayer cash, careers, and titles. A large expansion of the single player mode (we started with multiplayer in mind and need some AI polish during Early Access to give you the solo challenge you deserve). We'll be launching a number of AI opponents to make you sweat on your way to the top in upcoming free content upgrades as we move toward completing our Early Access roadmap. You’ll progress through different venues and earn your place in the hall of champions. EOC Boxing was designed from the ground up to support multiplayer VR and we want to ensure that EOC strives for realism while striking the balance in playability. We trust that Early Access already offers players a stable and challenging multiplayer experience that is above all else, entertaining.",['English'],['English'],,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1687100/header.jpg?t=1646251386,,,support@nodtechcreative.com,True,False,False,0,,0,25,11,,1,0,,0,0,0,0,"Nodtech Creative Industries Ltd.,Era of Combat Boxing Ltd.",Nodtech Creative Industries Ltd.,"Single-player,Multi-player,PvP,Online PvP,Steam Achievements","Action,Sports,Early Access","Action,Boxing,Sports,VR,Multiplayer,Realistic,Early Access,3D,PvP,Combat,Physics,3D Fighter,Singleplayer","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1687100/ss_d3c99c42ea66b0d43d4db380d7c41561aa0bae84.1920x1080.jpg?t=1646251386,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1687100/ss_f126ddf41560b640e7d9d4cb4aa232009163df85.1920x1080.jpg?t=1646251386,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1687100/ss_60fe974582a5a7cfefd8d9fb1c1980cfb03c4edd.1920x1080.jpg?t=1646251386,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1687100/ss_1c55d5a414576c293e5c13cfcaddb94fa0ae2b43.1920x1080.jpg?t=1646251386,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1687100/ss_2538e45e8ef6ea6afcace810bf0e36d62f7b8609.1920x1080.jpg?t=1646251386,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1687100/ss_4bff93318aa870e44681127981fc5c4091a5fe63.1920x1080.jpg?t=1646251386,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1687100/ss_d8f22c05604b9d5047582de18468f373349aba34.1920x1080.jpg?t=1646251386,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1687100/ss_90c0a83e0d5f7f6f3dccd20e465e5d643b56c25c.1920x1080.jpg?t=1646251386,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1687100/ss_3e0d1cf992c75249cf8c09c1ec6df04451e72417.1920x1080.jpg?t=1646251386,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1687100/ss_ffdb145757b735fe3384a155df199d7e117aa3c9.1920x1080.jpg?t=1646251386,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1687100/ss_6fcd84ecfd2c1c56fd4127cab36aa5b638a152c4.1920x1080.jpg?t=1646251386,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1687100/ss_3d54aa4d278a08915eb62cd879e558b42ba57b72.1920x1080.jpg?t=1646251386,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1687100/ss_1f061bfc953a713f9b40c4b9680706f270eadd66.1920x1080.jpg?t=1646251386,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1687100/ss_4d79b467cc5c4476e8a7c271e8479098d8f22f2a.1920x1080.jpg?t=1646251386","http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256870181/movie_max.mp4?t=1646251374,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256876163/movie_max.mp4?t=1646251378"

It's simple: build your ship and blast everything that comes your way. Wrack up points as you go and keep the Graps (future space money) earned from everything you destroy. The more Graps you make, the better you can equip your next ship, and the better chance you'll stand of lasting longer in the pit. The goal? Set the high score and become champion of the Star-Pit! This is my first attempt at making this style of game, and I sincerely hope it provides you plenty of entertainment. If you encounter any issues along the way or just want to say hello, feel free to reach out to me on Twitter or through my website. I'm always looking for feedback so I can improve, so don't hesitate to reach out! Thanks for checking out the game, and good luck in the pit! Matthew Milson - Puddledock Games Starships are made up of individual components called 'Star-Chips'. They are the guts of the ship: thrusters, laser guns, shields, etc. They can be placed in whatever arrangement you want. Once your ship is designed, you are placed in the Star-Pit to battle enemy starships and put your creation to the ultimate test. As chips on the ship are destroyed, the ship loses whatever functionality they provided. Earn points and Graps for destroying enemies starships chip-by-chip and spend those hard earned funds on your next starship. Enemy ships get increasingly more difficult the longer you last in the pit. Also there's space mines. Watch out for those.

You’re a recent graduate from the Astral College and strike officer training, you have just been posted to the Astral Corps’ Levantine Regiment, Hoplites troop, and been given command of the Fifth Platoon. You must prove your professional competence to your fellow officers to qualify as a strike officer, while fighting a rebel army and combatting a deadly plague on a hostile planet. Fog of War: The Battle for Cerberus is a 170,000-word military sci-fi interactive novel by Bennett R. Coles, where your choices control the story, based in the universe of the award-winning Virtues of War novels.

You know that your forces are up against the rebel leader, Major Zhang: notorious across the galaxy as a formidable enemy. Meanwhile, a deadly plague has broken out on Cerberus and is spreading quickly. The Astral Corps has a vaccine en route from another star system, but the local population has to be convinced to accept the vaccine when it arrives. Will you be able to put down the rebellion? Will the locals accept your bid to ensure their safety? When you find yourself separated from the rest of the Hoplite platoons and harried by rebel forces, how will you survive in the Cerberan landscape?
